4. in task2,3,4, the task 2 uses signifinantly more number of interations. also the tour length is larger than the other two.
the performance in task3 really depends signifinantly on the starting city. it is better than the task2 though.
task 4 has a slight edge over the task3 and i taks 4 is better than the other two.

6. in my case, task2 and task6 give exactly the same plot.

7. they are exactly the same, i think 7 is better than 3 is general cases, but in this case, can't say anything. 

8. exactly same. i think 8 is better than 3 but in this case in general, can't say anything.
